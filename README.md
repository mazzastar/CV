Experience
----------

5 years in financial technology working in a variety of roles in the sector. 

### Analyst Developer (Trinity Risk and Core Team) / Brady plc **2010&mdash;2012**
Working on various bug fixes and enhancements for the Trinity trading platform used for the commodities trading market. The key technologies used are: SQL, VB6 and VB.NET using Oracle databases

  - Value-At-Risk - I became the main developer on this module used to hedge portfolio risks. Although the module was currently being used by clients, I was tasked with bringing the module into a more stable and usable state. This required analysing undocumented legacy code which required fixing and becoming familiar with Monte Carlo simulations
  - Correcting .NET conversions of VB6 legacy code and designs so functionality was consistent across both versions
  - Maintenance and enhancements to the Trinity system to tailor the software for existing clients
  - Writing and adapting bespoke reports for clients
  - Creating documentation for undocumented functionality

### Technology Analyst / Lloyds Banking Group (HBOS Treasury Heritage) **2007&mdash;2010**

                       - Capturing business requirements from end users
  - Super Structure - Maintenance of the internal XML messaging system used in the Treasury and Trading systems based on WebSphere MQ technology
Small development work included changing the single-threaded queue loading system written in Java to be multi-threaded whilst investigating the possibility of simplifying the XML schemas
Writing schemas for transforming generic financial data into application-specific formats
	Analytics Pricing Support (Front Office Risk and PnL reporting)
Optimisation, analysis, testing and running of batch jobs for front/middle office
